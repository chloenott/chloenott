## About Me

Hi! Iâ€™m Chloe (they/she). My life at the moment is all things software development. I am a software development sponge. I want to learn how to develop better software. I want to help develop great software for others.

I am coming from an atypical background. My degree is in physics. I was a manufacturing engineer for a few years. I can probably offer a unique perspective as a result, or at the very least, a LinkedIn skills list that keeps hitting the number-of-skills cap.

Want to do a practice whiteboard with me? Feel free to bug me! Want to be convinced to watch Gundam Unicorn? Feel free to bug me!
