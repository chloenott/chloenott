## About Me

Hi! I’m Chloe (they/she). My life at the moment is all things software development. I am a software development sponge. I want to learn how to develop better software. I want to help develop great software for others.

I am coming from an atypical background. My degree is in physics. I was a manufacturing engineer for a few years. I can probably offer a unique perspective as a result, or at the very least, a LinkedIn skills list that keeps hitting the number-of-skills cap.

Want to do a practice whiteboard with me? Feel free to bug me! Want to be convinced to watch Gundam Unicorn? Feel free to bug me!

## Projects for Fun

### Arcade Cat ([github](https://github.com/MCK-Team/Arcade-Game))

In one week, K'Lan, Miguel, and I learned how to use Python Arcade from zero to create this 2D sidescroller using freely available assets. It was fun working on a game! Recommend.

### MailPal ([github](https://github.com/something-basic))

Joseph, K'Lan, Miguel, Jordan, and I created this GMail dashboard, also in one week (noticing a trend here?). Built with react, node/express, and the gmail API. Secured with OAuth. The website is not at all optimized, but interestingly in the demo gif below, each click to update the chart view fires off tens to hundreds of concurrent API requests in a split second. We had like 100k API calls made within like 24 hours for one user. I love the inefficiency! (Not really).

### Mental Health Website ([deployed](https://mental-health-website-cf201d79.github.io/mental-health-website/) | [github](https://github.com/mental-health-website-cf201d79/mental-health-website))

Brandon, Ibraheem, and I created this vanilla JS/HTML/CSS website from scratch to raise awareness of mental health conditions. There's also a screening questionnaire to screen for a few mental health conditions. While the questions are pooled from legitimate tests, I don't have the confidence nor qualifications to accept that liability. Please go to more thoroughly vetted sources instead.

### BigTextbox ([github](https://github.com/chloenott/big-textbox))

Something I made for myself. It's a bit difficult to understand my voice, especially with a mask, and I wanted a solution. I wasn't satisfied with any similar apps already out there, so I made one that fits exactly what I'm looking for: shows very big text on the screen with minimal keypresses, has favorites, and is otherwise lightweight and fast to use. The text adjusts in size as needed to fit everything in one view. I use it quite often!
