## About Me

Hi! I’m Chloe (they/she). My degree is in physics, was a manufacturing engineer for a bit, and now I’m spending time working on a multiplayer browser game that I wish existed.

## Projects for Fun

### Apple Smash ([github](https://github.com/NotFFTT/game) | [demo](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chloenott_final-project-presentation-online-multiplayer-activity-6896509601265664001-HdP-))

In five days, Brannon, David, Miguel, and I made this online multiplayer action game built on experiences from Arcade Cat. Python Arcade does not support multiplayer, but with an exceedingly quick crash course in python's low-level networking interface library, "sockets," with specific settings, and a bunch of other stuff, we were able to get the high-quality low-lag online gameplay we were hoping for. We used a DigitalOcean droplet so that players anywhere can connect to the game's server. Both the client and server are threaded, for various reasons, that in turn keep update and frame rates as fast as possible. We are very proud of the result and I am quite happy to have had the opportunity to work with my teammates on this game.

### Arcade Cat ([github](https://github.com/MCK-Team/Arcade-Game))

In one week, K'Lan, Miguel, and I learned how to use Python Arcade from zero to create this 2D sidescroller using freely available assets. It was fun working on a game! Recommend.

### MailPal ([github](https://github.com/something-basic))

Joseph, K'Lan, Miguel, Jordan, and I created this GMail dashboard, also in one week (noticing a trend here?). Built with react, node/express, and the gmail API. Secured with OAuth. The website is not at all optimized, but interestingly in the demo gif below, each click to update the chart view fires off tens to hundreds of concurrent API requests in a split second. We had like 100k API calls made within like 24 hours for one user. I love the inefficiency!

### Mental Health Website ([deployed](https://mental-health-website-cf201d79.github.io/mental-health-website/) | [github](https://github.com/mental-health-website-cf201d79/mental-health-website))

Brandon, Ibraheem, and I created this vanilla JS/HTML/CSS website from scratch to raise awareness of mental health conditions. There's also a screening questionnaire to screen for a few mental health conditions. While the questions are pooled from legitimate tests, I don't have the confidence nor qualifications to accept that liability. Please go to more thoroughly vetted sources instead.

### BigTextbox ([github](https://github.com/chloenott/big-textbox))

Something I made for myself. It's a bit difficult to understand my voice, especially with a mask, and I wanted a solution. I wasn't satisfied with any similar iOS apps already out there, so I learned how to use Swift/SwiftUI and made one that fits exactly what I'm looking for: shows very big text on the screen with minimal keypresses, has favorites, and is otherwise lightweight and fast to use. The text adjusts in size as needed to fit everything in one view. I use it quite often!
